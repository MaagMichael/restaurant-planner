Assuming you have loaded the JSON data into a table (say, called reservations) 
with columns such as timestamp, start_date, end_date, action, and name, one common
approach is to use a window function to determine the latest event (by timestamp)
for each reservation (defined as the combination of name, start_date, and end_date).
Then, you can filter those groups where the final action is a reservation. 
For example, in PostgreSQL you might write:

WITH LatestAction AS (
  SELECT 
    name, 
    "start-date" AS start_date,
    "end-date" AS end_date,
    action,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY name, "start-date", "end-date"
      ORDER BY timestamp DESC
    ) AS rn
  FROM reservations
)
SELECT name, start_date, end_date
FROM LatestAction
WHERE rn = 1
  AND action = 'reservation';
